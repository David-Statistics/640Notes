The set $S$ of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the *sample space*  

Examples:

 * Coin: $S = \{H,T\}$  
 * Time between mosquito bites: $S = (0,\infty)$

```

```{block2, type = 'rmddefinition'}

A sample space is *countable* if there exists a 1-1 correspondence with a subset of the integers. Otherwise it is *uncountable*

Examples:

 * Coin: countable
 * Time between mosquito bites: uncountable

```

```{block2, type = 'rmddefinition'}

A subset of the sample space is called an *event*

```

```{block2, type = 'rmddefinition'}

**Event Relationtions**

 * *Containment*: $A \subset B$ iff $x \in A \rightarrow x \in B$
 * *Equality*: $A = B$ iff $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$

```

```{block2, type = 'rmddefinition'}

**Set Operations**

 * *Union*: $A \cup B = \{X : x \in A \mbox{ or } x \in B\}$
 * *Intersection*: $A \cap B = \{X : x \in A \mbox{ and } x \in B\}$
 * *Complementation*: $A^C = \{X : x \not\in A\}$

```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtheorem'}

For any 3 events $A$, $B$, and $C$ defined on $S$:

* *Commutativity*: $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$
* *Associativity*: $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$
* *distributive*: $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \mbox{ and } A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
* *DeMorgan's Law*: $(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C \mbox{ and } (A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C$

```

```{block2, type = 'rmdexample'}

Let $N =$ the number of the first defective engine 
$S = \{1,2,...\}$  
Let $A_i \equiv [N = i] = i^{th}$ engine is defective and previous $i-1$ are not defective.  
$\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i = S$  

Let $B_i = i^{th}$ engine is defective. $A_i \subset B_i$.  
$\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i = S$  

```

```{block2, type = 'rmddefinition'}

Two events, $A$, $B$ are *mutually exclusive* (or *disjoint*) if $A \cap B = \emptyset$

```
